### Rules of a Randori Session

* The presenter explains the coding challenge and devides the group into teams of approx. 5 persons
* The presenter starts the Randori with a pair from audience.
* The pair will use TDD (Test-Driven Development).
* One half of the pair is changed every 5 minutes.
* The pair on the keyboard should continuously explain what they are doing.
* The pair on the keyboard should stop when someone from the audience falls off the sled â€” and only continue when that someone is back on track again.
